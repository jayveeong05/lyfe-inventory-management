## 🔍 Data Interpretation

### Summary Calculations
- **Stock In**: Count of items added in selected month
- **Stock Out**: Count of items with non-Active status in selected month  
- **Remaining**: (All Stock In from beginning) - (All Stock Out from beginning) until end of month

### Size vs Category Breakdown
- **Size Breakdown**: Only items with meaningful sizes (65 Inch, 75 Inch, etc.)
- **Category Breakdown**: ALL items grouped by equipment category

### Status Filtering
- **Included in Stock Out**: Reserved, Delivered, Invoiced, etc.
- **Excluded from Stock Out**: Active (items still in stock)

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "No data found for selected month"
- **Check**: Verify month/year selection
- **Solution**: Try different month or check if data exists in database

#### "Loading takes too long"
- **Cause**: Large dataset processing
- **Solution**: Wait for cache to build (first load), subsequent loads will be faster

#### "Summary totals don't match breakdown"
- **Explanation**: This is normal! Summary includes ALL items, size breakdown excludes "Others" category

#### "Missing panel sizes (like 98 Inch)"
- **Cause**: Flutter rendering errors preventing complete table display
- **Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - All panel sizes now display correctly
- **Solution**: Resolved border styling conflicts in table rendering

#### "Flutter rendering exceptions"
- **Symptoms**: App crashes or blank screens when viewing size breakdown
- **Cause**: BorderRadius + hairline border conflict
- **Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - No more rendering exceptions
- **Solution**: Implemented conditional border styling

#### "Missing categories in breakdown"
- **Check**: Verify data exists for selected month
- **Solution**: Categories only appear if they have activity in the selected month

### Performance Tips
- **First Load**: May take longer as cache builds
- **Subsequent Loads**: Much faster due to caching
- **Large Datasets**: Use batch processing automatically handles this
- **Cache Refresh**: Happens automatically every 5 minutes
